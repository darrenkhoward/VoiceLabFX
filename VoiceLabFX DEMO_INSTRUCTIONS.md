## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips

- **Use short audio clips** (30 seconds or less) for faster processing
- **Processing takes 5-10 seconds** - be patient!
- **Download button appears** after processing is complete
- **Try all 3 presets** to hear the different effects

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Nothing happens when I click Process"**
- Make sure you uploaded an audio file first
- Make sure you selected a preset
- Wait a few seconds - it's processing!

**"It's taking forever"**
- Longer audio files take longer to process
- Try a shorter clip (under 1 minute)

**"I don't hear any difference"**
- Make sure you downloaded the OUTPUT file, not your original
- Try a different preset with more obvious effects (like "Bathroom Caller")
